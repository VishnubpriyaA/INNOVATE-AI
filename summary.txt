📌 Project Title:
         Predicting Match Winners Using Game Statistics (Games.csv + Players.csv)

🎯 Objective:
        To analyze historical basketball game data and build a predictive model that forecasts the match winner using score-related and team-based features.

📂 Dataset Summary:
 Games.csv: 71,879 matches (home/away teams, scores, date, attendance)
Players.csv: 6,530 player profiles (draft data, physical attributes)

🧪 Methods Used:
 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Pandas)
 Exploratory Data Analysis (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
 Machine Learning Model: Random Forest Classifier
 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

📊 Model Accuracy:
✔️ 82.4% accuracy using Random Forest
✔️ Most important features: Home Score, Away Score, Home Team Identity

🔍 Key Insights:
 Home team score is the strongest indicator of match outcome.
 Certain cities consistently host high-scoring matches.
 Random Forest model outperforms simpler classifiers like Decision Tree.

💡 Recommendations:
 Include player-level performance metrics in future iterations.
 Use advanced feature engineering with draft info and attendance impact.
 Expand model to include live-match data for real-time prediction.
